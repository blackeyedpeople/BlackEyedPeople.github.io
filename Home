	<h2>The Official Black Eyed People Archives</h2>
	
	<p>What are the black eyed people? . People, mostly kids, with eyes completely blacked out appear at people's home or vehicle, knock on the door, and then insist upon getting inside. Anyone who encountered them has almost immediately felt an overwhelming sense of dread.</p>
	 
	
	<p>Shaking the image out of your head, you assume that it was some 
	peculiar anomaly of your eyesight, however the feeling still lingers
	for weeks, months or years.
	</p>
	
	<p>They often appear as children and travel in groups of 2 or 3, but there are many stories of encounters with adults with black eyes.
	 </p>
	
	<p>"What is their purpose?" Well, one thing is for certain, the personalities and intentions of black eyed people are just as varied as any one of the six billion people populating the planet. While a number of witnesses believe that the black eyed people act as benevolent guardians watching and guiding us, just as many witnesses have no doubt of the evil soul-wrenching potential of these beings. Some people believe they are a type of inter-dimensional being while others believe they are alien hybrids. One can only hope that serious research into this paranormal (or psychological) genre will paint a clear understanding of the nature and make-up of these dark, mysterious “people”. That day has not come </p>

	
	<p>Until then, this site brings together hundreds of witnesses who took
	the time and energy to detail their experiences in order to help us
	develop some kind of consensus about of the very strange nature of
	black eyed people. You are encouraged to sift and read through them to come
	to your own conclusions. </p>
